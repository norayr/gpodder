.SH "USAGE FOR BUG REPORTING"
.TP
This command is useful if you want to report a bug in gPodder:
.TP
.B gpodder-backup \-\-create bug123.gpo.tar.gz \-\-fake-downloads
Backup your current data to file \fIbug123.gpo.tar.gz\fR, but don't store
download data (create zero-size dummy files instead). You can then attach
\fIbug123.gpo.tar.gz\fR to the bug report.
.TP
If you are instructed to try gPodder from a "clean state", you can use the following command (be sure to backup your data before!):
.TP
.B gpodder-backup \-\-purge
Remove all gPodder data, so you can start from a clean state
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B gpodder-backup \-\-create today.gpo.tar.gz
Backup your current data to file \fItoday.gpo.tar.gz\fR
.TP
.B gpodder-backup \-\-extract mybackup.gpo.tar.gz
Restore (without purging) the contents of \fImybackup.gpo.tar.gz\fR
.TP
.B gpodder-backup \-\-extract default.gpo.tar.gz \-\-purge
Remove current data, then restore the contents of \fIdefault.gpo.tar.gz\fR
